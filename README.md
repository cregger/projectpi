# projectpi
An attempt to install OpenProject on Raspberry Pi 4

# Image your Pi
I used Raspberry Pi Imager v1.8.4 from https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
  Choose Raspberry Pi 4
  For Operating System choose Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS (64-Bit) 
  I used the settings dialog to configure my user account, wifi, and SSH access in advanced options.
  When complete eject the disk, insert it into your Pi and boot up.
  For first boot I had a screen connected so I could find my IP for SSH access

# First Boot
  Login and update, then determine your IP address
